Honors-Projects
===============
As part of an honors project, I was required to factor in a way to deal with uncertainty when scanning fingerprints. The 'fingerprints' were plain text files which resembled actual fingerprints. My algorithm used 2D arrays to scan and compare each character to calculate the matching fingerprint percentage, and either pass or fail authentication depending on an user-adjustable threshold. I also implemented a GUI for ease of use.
